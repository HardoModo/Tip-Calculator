# Tip Calculator

This is a web-based application that allows you to calculate how much each person should pay for a shared bill, including the tip. The app takes inputs like bill amount, party size, and the amount of tip the party wants to leave and returns a value that the whole party should pay if the bill is split evenly. It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

As you type in the bill amount, party size, and tip amount, the app will automatically update the total amount due. You can see the total amount due change in real-time as you adjust these values. If you choose to remove your own portion from the bill, the app will adjust the total amount due accordingly.

## Additional Features

In addition to the basic features listed above, this app also allows you to:

- Remove your own portion for the bill if you want to pay individually.
- Choose between percentage-based or flat dollar amount tips.
